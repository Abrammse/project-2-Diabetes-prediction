#### Goals  
The goal of this project is to  build a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning

  
 
## Description   
project-2-Diabetes-prediction to build a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. This project is done in Python. In this project, we use Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.

## How to run   
First, install dependencies   
```bash
# install  project   
https://github.com/Abrammse/project-1-ROCK-VS-Mine-Prediction-ML-.git
 ```   
 Next, navigate to any file and run it.   
 ```bash
# module folder
cdDiabetes-prediction 

# Run module on co-lap or Anaconda
 if use co-lap don't  forget to  upload  his dataset on co-lap   and change the link dataset


```
